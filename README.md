# CuteCalculator - or Qt Calculator
A badly-made attempt of integrating Qt in C++ Calculator App

As of now, I am learning C#, so i can integrate some of my ideas to make GUI's. But, for the last few days, I've been *hard at work*  trying to use a language that i feel more confortable with, to integrate a GUI. So this is it. Please downrate-it, repo, fork-it, or you can even steal it if you want. Just teach me a few things on how to code with Qt. The source-code is also documented, but if you have any doubt please, don't hesitate to contact-me. Let's be friends.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
